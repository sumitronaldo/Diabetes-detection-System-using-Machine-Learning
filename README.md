# Diabetes-detection-System-using-Machine-Learning

This is a small project made by me, which uses SVM algorithm under sklearn kit of python library. It actually helps determining whether a person is having Diabetes or not.
This actually done by provinding several data as provided in the dataset like glucose level, age and many other details. Once these details were provided, our code does the other work instantly and shows you the Result.

Dont be shocked after watching the RESULT, keep taking care of yourself and be fit.
